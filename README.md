# TWRP-suzuran
TWRP build script for Sony Z5 Compact "suzuran"

You will need repo and Android build tools to correctly build TWRP on your machine.

Have a look at LineageOS wiki for the prerequisites:

   https://wiki.lineageos.org/devices/suzuran/build

For the build I have used my own [android_bootable_recovery](https://github.com/ant9000/android_bootable_recovery), which tweaks the TWRP theme in order to protect recovery with a password.

If you build yourself, the TWRP-suzuran.sh script will guide you on how to add a password during image creation.
